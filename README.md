#Migatte selfbot

A selfbot I made months ago, that I made public because I no longer do discord nukes

#Getting started

Auto dependencies download, just run the `migatte.py`

#Commands

Run the selfbot and do: `x!cmds` | To change pages do: `x!kaioken`, `x!revert`

#Info

You can edit the code as much you want and reupload it
